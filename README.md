# PrefireCalculator
 An algorithm to determine prefiring to moving targets

 This algorithm determines target points that can be selected to prefire on. The system works by subdividing the targets path into many line segments. From there, prefire calculations are done to determine how to land the shot. Be specifying the enemy size, it allows extreme wiggle room.

 This system is intended to be used for advanced targetting systems for use in video games.
